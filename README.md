## About this Project
The objective of this project was to make a responsive weather application that takes in the user's current city and in turn responds with a current and five day weather forecast. This was done by using the Open Weather API and JavaScript by taking the user's input and a weather API key to translate the weather into html elements that are then displayed on the page!
